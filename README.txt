In this dataset, we have data of almost all google play store apps and
we are going to analyse and cover all the prospects of data science algorithms.
we will go implement most common machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest Regressor
My findings are:
1. all you need to know about he android market
3. google play-store EDA
3. machine learning to predict app ratings
